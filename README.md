Welcome to ApplyIT project!

As juniors (like me) are currently struggling on the labor market with many applied offers, I've come up with the idea to store your applications in the app to easily keep track on them.
Basically what it is made for, is that you can add applications for offers that you applied for, set their statuses, positions or company names.

App lets you show them, filter all applications or show some analytics results to present how it is going.

The app is basically made because of private purposes, but it is available at the link below:

For now it's a demo, but I'm still working on the functionalities.
